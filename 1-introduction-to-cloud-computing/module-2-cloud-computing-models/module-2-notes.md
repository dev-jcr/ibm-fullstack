### Service models
SaaS application
Software wihtout installing. User: anyone
In addition to the PaaS and IaaS, it manages applications and data

PaaS platform
Mix of both. User: developer
Cloud provider manages the platform infrastructure: OS, dev tools, db, business analytics.

IaaS infrastructure
Provides compute, networking and storage resources,  to consumers on-demand, over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. User: Sys admin
Cloud provider manages data centers, cooling, power, network and security, servers and storage

Infrastructure as a Service IaaS
VMs include an Hypervisor managing OSs inside wich is the data, apps and middleware.
Have:
Physical data centers: experienced but not in contact
Compute: memory, storage, VM
network: virtualizacion and APIs
Storage: object, file, block

Used to test and develop faster, abstracting low level components
Business continuity and disaster recovery less expensive
Faster deployment and scaling
High performance computing accessible
Big Data Analysis economically viable

Storage is used as backups and worloads too

Track and monitor usage and performance

Object storage is the most common mode of storage in the cloud, 

Platform as a service PaaS
Develop, deploy and run applications
Mainly includes servers, networkds, storage, os, app runtimes, APIs, Middleware, Databases

In addition to managing physical site, storage and networking and security, it manages hypervisors and OS, dev tools and runtimes, databases and analytics
High level of abstraction
Simplify dev job
executes code accordint to policies
deploy, run and scale apps, efficiently
support a range of application infrastruture capabilities (middleware)

Used for: API, IoT, Business analytics/intelligence, Business Process Management (BPM), Master Data Management (MDM)

Provide scalability, faster time to market, greater agility and innovation without investing in resources needed

Key offerings

Lesson 1 Summary 

In this lesson, you have learned the following:

    With IaaS, the cloud provider manages physical resources. 

    With PaaS, the provider manages the platform infrastructure. 

    In the SaaS model, the provider hosts and manages the applications and data.

    Infrastructure-as-a-Service is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental computer, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the network, on a pay-as-you-go basis. 

    The key components of cloud infrastructure are:

        Physical data centers

        Compute

        Network

        Storage

    Platform-as-a-Service is a cloud computing model that provides customers with a complete platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure. 

    The high level of abstraction, support services, runtime environments, rapid deployment mechanisms, and middleware capabilities distinguishes PaaS clouds.

     PaaS advantages are:

        Scalability

        Faster time to market products and services.

        Greater agility and innovation

    Software-as-a-Service is a cloud offering that provides users with access to a service provider’s cloud-based software. 

    SaaS characteristics are:

        Multitenant architecture 

        Security, compliance, and maintenance

        Customization of applications

        Subscription model

        Scaling

    SaaS advantages are:

        Direct procurement of solutions

        Improved workforce productivity and efficiency

        Enable distribution of software costs

Cloud models

Public Cloud Deployment model
Resources distributed on an as-needed service

On-demand resources
significant economies of scale
Highly available

Concerns
Security
Data sovereignty compliance

Use cases
1.teams can focus on building and testing apps, reducing time-to-market 
2. businesses wit fluctuating capacity and resourcing needs
3. build secondary infrastructures for disaster recovery, data protection and business continuity
4. greater accesibility, easy distribution and backing up
5. IT departments outsourcing management of less critical and standardized business platforms

Private cloud model
Exclusive use, exist on premises
internal or external
VPC Virtual Private Cloud

It adds control.
internal control by IT
Reduced costs
better scalability
controlled access and security
greater agility

Common uses
1. Modernize and unify in-house and legacy apps
2. Build applications anywhere & move them without compromising
3. Full control of security and compliance issues.


Hybrid cloud
Flexibility
Workloads move freely
Leverage public and private clouds with cloud bursting

Interoperable, scalable, portable


By how many and how it is deployed:

Hybrid monocloud

Hybrid multicloud

Composite multicloud

 It allows security and compliance
 scalability and resilience
 resource optimization
 cost-saving

 Uses:
 SaaS integration
 Data and AI integration
 Enhancing legacy apps
 VMware migration
