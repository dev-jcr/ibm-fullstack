## Overview of cloud computing

### Lesson 1

Flexibility and scalability
latest trends
extra bandwith and faster internet speeds
availability
efficient marketing

Model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources

History
1950s
Large-scale mainframes

1970s
Virtual Machine allowed multiple distinct environments with the same hardware

Virtualization
Including hypervisor, separating OS from each machine in the shared resources

CapEx model required people to buy capacity for the proyected need

CapOp model is pay as you need

Agility
Competitivity
Flexibility

n this lesson, you have learned:

    Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.

    The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.

    Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.

    Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our time include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.

### Lesson 2

    In this lesson, you have learned:

    The adoption of cloud technologies enables enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive and to create differentiated customer experiences. Organizations are asking not whether they should move to the cloud but rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud.

    Some case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses have created by adopting the cloud:

        American Airlines adopting cloud technologies to deliver customer value rapidly across its enterprise

        UBank leveraging cloud platform services to give more control to their developers, thereby removing barriers to innovation

        Bitly leveraging the scalability offered by cloud infrastructure for low-latency delivery to its geographically  dispersed enterprise customers

        ActivTrades leveraging the infrastructure, storage, network, and security offerings on the cloud to accelerate execution and delivery of new functions in their online trading systems to their customers
